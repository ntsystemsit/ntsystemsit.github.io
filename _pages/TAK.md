Tom's Admin Kit, or TAK, is a PowerShell script module that contains useful tools which I collected or created over the years. I tried to give credits where appropriate and where I could still remember the source :)

The main goal of creating the module and writing the scripts it contains, was learning PowerShell and making my job a little bit easier. As I am currently looking into continuous integration, I used this module to build an example deployment pipeline. You can read more about that [here](http://ntsystems.it/post/introducing-tak).
