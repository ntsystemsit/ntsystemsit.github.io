I'm an experienced IT professional and consultant with a strong background in networking technologies. In my current role, I empower customers to get the most out of their unified communications investments. I try to automate all the things (with [PowerShell]({{ site.baseurl }}/PowerShell/)) and I try to learn something new every day.
