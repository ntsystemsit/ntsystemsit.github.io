<h1>Windows</h1> <p>Some days ago, on September 30, @tmyerson and @joebelfiore introduced Windows 10 and announced the availability of a Technical Preview. The announcement and some demos are on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfveyXCsiA8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. Some interesting new features such as snap for 4 windows and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_O-LrGL-YQ" target="_blank">continuum</a>, which switches between the start menu and the start screen based on whether or not a keyboard is connected, are coming to Windows 10.</p> <p>The preview can be downloaded at: <a title="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview</a></p> <p>Along with the tech preview of Windows 10 came the preview for the next version of Windows Server. A ton of new features will come to the next gen server OS, a notable one might be the SDN controller role, which provides a interface between higher layer applications (think SCVMM) and the software defined networking stack in Windows.</p> <p>The preview for Windows Server can be downloaded at: <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/evalcenter/dn781243?WT.mc_id=Blog_ServerCloud_Announce_TTD">http://technet.microsoft.com/evalcenter/dn781243</a></p> <h1>Delve</h1> <p>The long rumored and previously shown “Office Graph” aka “Oslo” has started rolling out to Office 365 customers under the new name: “Office Delve”.</p> <p><a href="http://ntsystems.azurewebsites.net/assets/image_670.png"><img width="244" height="19" title="image" style="border: 0px currentColor; display: inline;" alt="image" src="http://ntsystems.azurewebsites.net/assets/image_thumb_668.png" border="0"></a> </p> <p>To get a chance to test new features before regular users get them, one needs to enable “First Release” in the Office 365 Admin Center.</p> <p><a href="http://ntsystems.azurewebsites.net/assets/image_671.png"><img width="206" height="244" title="image" style="border: 0px currentColor; display: inline;" alt="image" src="http://ntsystems.azurewebsites.net/assets/image_thumb_669.png" border="0"></a> </p> <h1>Sway</h1> <p>Another addition to the Office family, by the name of “Sway”, started a limited preview a couple of days ago. More information and some demos can be found here: <a title="https://sway.com/" href="https://sway.com/">https://sway.com/</a></p> <h1>Keybase.io</h1> <p>After signing up some time ago, I finally received an invite for <a href="https://keybase.io">https://keybase.io</a>. Keybase is an interesting approach to make public key cryptography more accessible to users, among many other features it provides&nbsp; a simple way of finding someone’s public key, based on their social media and web identities, in order to be able to encrypt messages for them. It is available as a command-line tool but the website works as client, too.</p> <p>View my publicly-auditable identity here: <a href="https://keybase.io/tomt">https://keybase.io/tomt</a> </p> <p><br>So long,<br>Tom</p>
