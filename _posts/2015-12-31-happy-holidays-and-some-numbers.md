<p>It’s this time of the year again, everybody is trying to relax a bit and maybe making some plans for the coming year. Well at least that’s what I’m up to these days.</p> <h1>Numbers</h1> <p>I thought this would be a good opportunity to share some statistics of our blog. So a little more than a year ago, we moved to azure and cloudflare, I took the following numbers mostly from cloudflare.</p> <p>We are blogging here since <strong>July 2009</strong>, that’s almost six and a half years or around 2350 days. wow.</p> <p>In this time, we produced <strong>250 posts</strong>, some in german, some in english. Even though there have been some times with lower activity, that’s still about one post every 10 days.</p> <p>All of this started over a few beers, and neither of us would have thought that it might last this long. Yet here we are, making plans for 2016 and beyond.</p> <p>Now according to cloudflare around&nbsp;<strong>8000 unique visitors</strong> are stopping by our little site each month, around 300 every single day. Not really mind-blowing, but also not bad.</p> <h1>Greetings </h1> <p>With that said, we’d like to wish all of you a happy new year and we do certainly hope to see you around.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Cheers, Tom</p>
