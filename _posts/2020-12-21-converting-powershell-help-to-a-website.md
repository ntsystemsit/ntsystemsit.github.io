With the migration of our blog I'm also trying move the help content for various PowerShell scripts/modules to a single location and make updating/managing that content easier. I've recently found the [platyPS](https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS) module, which can be used to create markdown formatted files for PowerShell help topics.

Now you might have read that our blog is powered by Jekyll, which is just a static-site generator that turns markdown files into html. So, obviously, if I would be able to convert PowerShell help content to markdown files, I could simply put them into a folder an serve them via the blog.

# Create markdown files

The first step is to install platyPS (available on the PS Gallery) and create the markdown files for every function.

```powershell
Install-Module platyPS
Import-Module platyPS, TAK

foreach ($cmdlet in (Get-Command -Module TAK)) { 
    $h = Get-Help $($cmdlet.Name)
    $meta = @{
        'layout' = 'post';
        'author' = 'tto';
        'title' = $($cmdlet.Name);
        'category' = $($cmdlet.ModuleName);
        'tags' = 'OnlineHelp PowerShell';
        'excerpt' = "'$($h.Synopsis)'";
        'date' = $(Get-Date -Format yyyy-MM-dd);
    }
    if($h.Synopsis -notmatch "\[|\]") {
        New-MarkdownHelp -Command $cmdlet -OutputFolder tak-md-help -Metadata $meta -Force 
    }
}
```
The above example creates a `.md` help file for every function in the `TAK` module. The files are almost ready to be used by our Jekyll-powered blog, I'm using the `-Metadata` parameter to add some additional information to the 'front matter' of each file.

> Note: I could be using `New-MarkdownHelp -Module TAK` but that way, I was not able to include the metadata automatically.

# Rename files for Jekyll

The only thing that I have to do now, in order to have Jekyll pick up the files and create websites, is to rename them accordingly. 

```powershell
foreach ($file in (Get-ChildItem '.\tak-md-help\*.md')) {
    $timestamp = (Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd')
    $NewName = $timestamp, $file.name -join '-'
    Rename-Item -Path $file.FullName -NewName $NewName
}
```

The above example renames all `*.md` files in the `tak-md-help` folder to include a timestamp. 

> Note: PlatyPS does currently not work on macOS/Linux editions of PowerShell.

# Include HelpUri

The `Get-Help` command has an `-Online` parameter, that can be used to easily open a related link when looking for help. To include this functionality in my scripts, I just have to put the URL of the online article in the `[CmdletBinding()]` statement, like so:

```powershell
[CmdletBinding(HelpUri = 'https://ntsystems.it/PowerShell/TAK/test-tlsconnection/')]
```

That's it :)
