What a year.

<!-- more -->

True, I had to cancel some trips and I stayed home a lot more than usual, but apart from that, it was a pretty spectacular year for me. I moved to Amsterdam from a smaller city in the outskirts. Among others I was able to go to ZÃ¼rich, Sardinia, Marbella, and Napoli. In a prolonged episode of lockdown blues I managed to get about 1000 km on my road bike done. That was sometime before summer, since then I have been less active. I worked a lot. I learned a lot.

Since a certain global event made more travelling impossible, or at least not very recommendable, Iâ€™m staying in Amsterdam for the holiday season and started building this new site.
After more than 10 years, itâ€™s now time to say: Goodbye ntSystems.it

# Welcome onprem.wtf

Welcome to our new home. For now this site is still build with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). I replaced the default minima theme with a custom one, mostly because I wanted to learn and experiment with some CSS features.

The new site has a simpler layout with less clutter, should be easier to read on any screen, and it also has a dark theme. Actually, unless you select a theme, it will use the same settings that your operating system (or browser) uses. Pretty slick, right?

What about the domain name you ask? Well, this one was available and it kind of fits with what we are doing at the moment. If you find a better one, Iâ€™m open to suggestions ðŸ˜‰
